## **Introduction**
***
I built a fully responsive and modern **Food Website** that offers a complete and intuitive user experience. In this project, users can navigate through various pages including:

+ **Home**

+ **Menu**

+ **Mobile App**

+ **Contact Us**

+ **Admin Panel**

Users can easily browse the menu and add food items to their basket. By clicking the basket icon, they are directed to the **payment page**, where they can:


+ Review their selected items

+ See the total cost

+ Enter credit card details

+ Complete their food order securely

 The website also includes an **Admin Dashboard** where admins can:

+ View new and previous orders

+ Track the status of each order

+ Monitor the food preparation and delivery process in real-time

Additionally, restaurant owners have the ability to add new food items to the platform, making the system dynamic and scalable for multiple vendors.

## **Features**
***
+ **User Registration & Authentication**: Allow users to sign up, log in, and manage their accounts.

+ **Browse Menus**: Display food menus with detailed information and images.

+ **Add to Cart**: Add food items to the cart for order processing.

+ **Real-time Order Tracking**: Track orders from restaurant to delivery.

+ **Admin Panel**: Admin users can manage orders, products, and users.

+ **Secure Payment**: Integrated with payment gateway (Stripe or PayPal) for secure transactions.

## **Tech Stack**
